      "Fresh out of University with a First-Class degree in Software Engineering, I’m now laser-focused on converting that momentum into my first professional role. My days are split between hands-on personal projects that demonstrate real-world readiness, LeetCode reps to sharpen my algorithmic edge, and realistic job simulations that bridge the gap where commercial experience would normally sit.",
      "I specialise in full-stack development—bringing polished, user-friendly web applications to life end-to-end. I care as much about how an interface feels as how it performs under load, and I’m a big believer in using AI tooling thoughtfully to accelerate delivery without sacrificing code quality. I’m actively looking for a team where I can contribute to production work, keep leveling up, and bring those habits of continuous learning to a real product.",
      "When I’m not shipping something new or tackling another coding challenge, you’ll usually find me unwinding at the gym, hunting for fresh playlists, watching sports, or smashing my PS5 controller in the heat of EAFC Ultimate Team Sweat Fests (and somehow, I still buy the game every year). I also enjoy playing basketball and have a soft spot for TV dramas and reality series that lean dark and psychologically twisty—anything with moral tension and characters you can’t quite pin down."
